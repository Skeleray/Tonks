General thoughts and ideas:

	Bullets can bounce on walls. Have a limited ammount of bounces before they explode, can upgrade.

	bullets that split into more bullets on wall bounce.

	ram attack

	charge shot, goes faster and might bounce additional times, but you have to charge for a while while movement might be slower?

Tank types:

	Sword tank - tank with sword in it's barrel. Can swing head as meele combat, charge enemies. Can shoot sword at enemies but have to pick it up again

	drill tank, drill trough walls? shoot drill shots that goes ("slowly") trough walls
	
	Trumpet tank. Elephant tank,  suck in bullets, shoot em back.
